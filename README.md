# ReactJS-GroceryApp
My main intent with this project is to learn how to develop UIs with ReactJS. So far only a navifation bar has been
fully implemented. There are currently two sections (home section and about section) under construction. The next step
is to implement a smooth scrolling feature to move from one section to the next section of the page.
